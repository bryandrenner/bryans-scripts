Setting Up Vim
==============

1. Create symlinks to the appropriate `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` vimrc files in the
    home directory.
    
    For Windows, symlinks should be named `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`.
    
2. Create a symlink to the color scheme file in `~/.vim/colors`
    (or `~/vimfiles/colors` on Windows).

    Color scheme doesn't work well in Windows though.
